# 🌲 Random Forest Regressor using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Random Forest Regression** model using the **Scikit-learn** library to predict product sales based on multi-channel advertising spend. It's designed to show the power of ensemble learning in solving real-world business problems with accuracy and interpretability.

## 📘 Project Overview

Random Forest is a flexible and powerful supervised learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to get more accurate and stable predictions. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore a structured advertising dataset
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- ✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`
- 🌲 Train a model using `RandomForestRegressor()`
- 📈 Visualize actual vs predicted values
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- 🔍 Analyze feature importance to extract business insights

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is based on advertising budgets and corresponding product sales. It includes:

- 📺 **TV** — Budget spent on TV advertising  
- 📻 **Radio** — Budget spent on Radio advertising  
- 🗞️ **Newspaper** — Budget spent on Newspaper advertising  
- 💰 **Sales** — Product sales (target variable)

This structured and clean dataset is ideal for demonstrating regression modeling and business decision-making.
