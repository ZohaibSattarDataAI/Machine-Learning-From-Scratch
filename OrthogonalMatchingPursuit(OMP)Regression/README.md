# 📊 Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) Regression for Product Sales Prediction

This is my 18th project in the field of Machine Learning and Regression Modeling.

This project demonstrates how to implement an **Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) Regressor** using the scikit-learn library to predict **e-commerce product price** based on various business and marketing features.  
It showcases a **complete regression pipeline** — from data exploration to model training and evaluation — providing a practical foundation for solving **real-world predictive analytics problems** in retail, marketing, and inventory management.

## 📘 Project Overview

**Orthogonal Matching Pursuit** is a sparse regression method that is particularly effective when you want to identify a small subset of important features while maintaining strong predictive power.  
In this notebook, we walk through the **end-to-end regression process**, covering:

📥 Loading and inspecting the product dataset  
🔍 Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
🧼 Preprocessing numerical features using **StandardScaler**  
✂ Splitting the dataset using **train_test_split()**  
🧠 Training a regression model using **OrthogonalMatchingPursuit()**  
📈 Evaluating the model using regression metrics:  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score  

📊 Visualizing **predicted vs. actual values** with a regression plot

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized **product performance data** including marketing, sales, and product quality features.  
It is structured for regression tasks and includes the following feature types:

📢 **Marketing & Promotion Metrics** — Advertising spend, seasonal discounts, brand popularity  
📦 **Product Attributes** — Quality rating, days on market, number of reviews, average review score  
💰 **Sales Target** — Target variable representing actual or predicted product sales  

This dataset reflects **real-world retail scenarios** where accurate sales prediction can help optimize **marketing budgets, inventory planning, and pricing strategies**.
