# 📊 CatBoost Regression for Marketing Product Sales Prediction

This is my **12th project** in the field of Machine Learning and Regression Modeling.

This project demonstrates how to implement a **CatBoost Regressor** using the powerful **CatBoost** library to predict `product_sales` based on various marketing features. It showcases a complete regression pipeline — from data exploration to model training and evaluation — offering a strong foundation for solving real-world prediction tasks in business analytics and marketing optimization.

## 📘 Project Overview

*CatBoost* is a high-performance gradient boosting library developed by Yandex, especially effective on datasets with numerical and categorical features. In this notebook, we walk through the end-to-end regression process, covering:

- 📥 Loading and inspecting the marketing dataset  
- 🔍 Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- 🧼 Preprocessing and scaling numerical features using StandardScaler  
- ✂ Splitting the dataset using `train_test_split()`  
- 🧠 Training a regression model using `CatBoostRegressor()`  
- 📈 Evaluating model using regression metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score  
- 📊 Visualizing predicted vs. actual values with a regression plot

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset contains anonymized marketing data and associated product sales. It is structured for regression tasks and includes the following types of features:

- 📢 *Marketing Spend Channels* — Various numerical indicators related to promotional efforts  
- 👨‍💼 *Customer Attributes* — Demographic or behavioral indicators (if applicable)  
- 💰 *Product Sales* — Target numerical variable representing actual sales performance  

This dataset simulates real-world business scenarios where marketing efforts need to be quantified and predicted for better decision-making.
