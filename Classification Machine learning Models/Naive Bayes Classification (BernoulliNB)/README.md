# 🎯 Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classification using Scikit-learn  

This project demonstrates how to implement a *Bernoulli Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)* model using the Scikit-learn library to classify binary data. It highlights the strength of Naive Bayes when working with boolean (yes/no, true/false, 0/1) features, making it a lightweight yet powerful algorithm for binary classification tasks.

## 📘 Project Overview  
Bernoulli Naive Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem. It assumes that:  

- Features are independent (the “Naive” assumption).  
- Input features are binary (present/absent, yes/no).  

In this notebook, we:  

- 📥 Load and preprocess the dataset  
- 📊 Explore the data and prepare features  
- ✂ Split data using train_test_split()  
- ⚡ Train a model using *BernoulliNB*  
- 📈 Visualize predictions and confusion matrix  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  
  - Cross-Validation
