# 🎯 AdaBoost Classifier using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement an *AdaBoost Classification* model using the Scikit-learn library to classify data points based on structured datasets. It highlights the power of boosting algorithms in improving accuracy by combining multiple weak learners into a strong predictive model.

## 📘 Project Overview
AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple weak learners, typically shallow decision trees, and combines them to form a strong learner. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂ Split data using train_test_split()  
- ⚡ Train a model using AdaBoostClassifier() with a Decision Tree base estimator  
- 📈 Evaluate the classifier using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- 🔄 Perform Cross-Validation to check model stability
