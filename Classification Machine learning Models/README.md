# 🤖 Classification Machine Learning Models

Welcome to **Classification Machine Learning Models** — a structured, beginner-friendly, and professional repository containing classic **Machine Learning classification algorithms** implemented in two ways:

✅ **From Scratch (Pure Python)** — for a deeper understanding of the math & logic
✅ **With Scikit-learn** — for production-ready, optimized implementations

> 📌 This project focuses **only on Classification models**, with clean code, real datasets, and Jupyter notebooks for hands-on practice.
