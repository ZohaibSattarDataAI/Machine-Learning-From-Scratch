# 🎯 Linear Discriminant Classifier (LDC) using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Linear Discriminant Classification (LDC)** model using the Scikit-learn library to classify data points into distinct categories based on linear combinations of features. It showcases how LDC effectively separates multiple classes by maximizing class separability.

## 📘 Project Overview
**Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** is a supervised machine learning technique used for **dimensionality reduction and classification**.  
It assumes that different classes generate data based on Gaussian distributions and finds a linear combination of features that best separates these classes.

In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and prepare the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂️ Split the dataset using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `LinearDiscriminantAnalysis()`  
- 📈 Visualize performance with a confusion matrix  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using key metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a **structured classification dataset** (finance dataset in this case), where the goal is to predict whether a financial transaction belongs to a particular **category or risk level**.  
This dataset provides an excellent foundation for applying LDC in real-world decision-making scenarios.
