# 🎯 Stacking Classifier using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Stacking Classification** model using the Scikit-learn library to predict categorical outcomes based on structured datasets. It highlights the power of ensemble learning by combining multiple base classifiers into a single, strong predictive model.

## 📘 Project Overview
Stacking (Stacked Generalization) is an **ensemble learning technique** that integrates multiple base models (weak learners) and a meta-model (final estimator) to improve overall prediction accuracy.  
In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `StackingClassifier()` with Random Forest and Gradient Boosting as base estimators  
- 🧠 Use Logistic Regression as the final (meta) model  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - Confusion Matrix
