## 📘 Project Overview
Naive Bayes is a supervised learning algorithm based on Bayes’ Theorem with a strong (naive) assumption of feature independence. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 🧹 Perform preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding)  
- ✂ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `GaussianNB()`  
- 📏 Evaluate classification performance using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
- 📈 Visualize predictions and evaluation results
