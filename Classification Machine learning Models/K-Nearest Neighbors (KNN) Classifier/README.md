# 🎯 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification* model using the Scikit-learn library to classify data points based on their similarity to neighbors. It highlights the power of distance-based learning in solving classification problems effectively.

## 📘 Project Overview
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification. It predicts the class of a data point by looking at the majority label among its *k nearest neighbors*.  
In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `KNeighborsClassifier()`  
- 📈 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  
- 🔎 Visualize confusion matrix and decision boundaries
