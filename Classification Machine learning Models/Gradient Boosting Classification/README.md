# 🎯 Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBM) using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Gradient Boosting Classification** model using the Scikit-learn library to predict class labels based on structured datasets. It highlights the power of boosting algorithms in improving accuracy by combining multiple weak learners into a strong predictive model.

## 📘 Project Overview
Gradient Boosting is an **ensemble learning method** that builds decision trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `GradientBoostingClassifier()`  
- 📈 Visualize performance with confusion matrix and feature importance  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - ROC-AUC

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a **structured dataset** (clothing sales dataset in this case), where the goal is to predict whether an item is **sold (1)** or **not sold (0)**. This dataset provides a strong platform to demonstrate boosting-based classification for real-world predictive tasks.
