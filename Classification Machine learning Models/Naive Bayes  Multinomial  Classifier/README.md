# 🎯 Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier using Scikit-learn  

This project demonstrates how to implement a *Multinomial Naive Bayes Classification* model using the Scikit-learn library for text-based classification tasks. It highlights the efficiency and reliability of Naive Bayes in handling high-dimensional datasets such as document-term matrices.

## 📘 Project Overview  
Multinomial Naive Bayes is a probabilistic learning method based on applying Bayes’ theorem with strong independence assumptions. It is particularly effective for text data represented as word counts or frequencies. In this notebook, we:  

- 📥 Load and preprocess the dataset  
- 🔠 Convert text into numerical features using **CountVectorizer**  
- ✂ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `MultinomialNB()`  
- 📊 Evaluate the model using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
- 📈 Validate performance with cross-validation

## 📊 About the Dataset  
The dataset used in this project consists of **text samples** labeled as either *spam* or *not spam*. It provides a realistic scenario for demonstrating the application of text classification using Naive Bayes.
