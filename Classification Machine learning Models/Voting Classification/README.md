# 🎯 Voting Classifier using Scikit-learn  

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Voting Classification** model using the Scikit-learn library to classify real-world data with high accuracy.  
It showcases the power of **ensemble learning**, where multiple models (base estimators) are combined to make more stable and accurate predictions than any individual model alone.  

---

## 📘 Project Overview  
**Voting Classifier** is an ensemble learning technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**, and **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**.  
It works on the principle that combining multiple diverse models can yield better overall performance.  

In this notebook, we:  
- 📥 Load and preprocess the dataset  
- 📊 Perform data analysis and scaling  
- ✂️ Split the data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚙️ Train a **VotingClassifier** using soft voting (probability-based averaging)  
- 📈 Evaluate the model with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix  
- 🔍 Visualize model performance using a confusion matrix heatmap

## 📊 About the Dataset  
The dataset used in this project is a **real-world structured dataset** that contains multiple numerical and categorical features.  
It is designed for **multi-class classification**, where the goal is to predict a target label based on various environmental and behavioral indicators.

## ⚙️ Models Used in Ensemble  
1. **Logistic Regression** – A linear classifier used for probabilistic classification.  
2. **Random Forest Classifier** – A tree-based ensemble model reducing variance through bagging.  
3. **Gradient Boosting Classifier** – A sequential boosting method that improves weak learners iteratively.  
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** – A robust classifier that finds optimal decision boundaries.  

All models are combined using **soft voting**, averaging their probability predictions to make the final decision.
