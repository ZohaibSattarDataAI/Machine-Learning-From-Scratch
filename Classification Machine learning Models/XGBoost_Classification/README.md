# 🎯 XGBoost Classifier using Scikit-learn & XGBoost

This project demonstrates how to implement an **XGBoost Classification** model using the XGBoost and Scikit-learn libraries to predict categorical target values. It highlights the strength of gradient boosting algorithms in improving classification accuracy by combining multiple weak learners into a strong predictive model.

## 📘 Project Overview
XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is a powerful and efficient implementation of gradient boosting. It is widely used for structured/tabular datasets and often achieves **state-of-the-art results** in classification and regression tasks.  

In this notebook, we:  

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `XGBClassifier()` with optimized hyperparameters  
- 📈 Predict target classes on test data  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - Confusion Matrix
