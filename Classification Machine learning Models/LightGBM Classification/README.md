# 🚀 LightGBM Classification using Scikit-learn & LightGBM

This project demonstrates how to implement a **LightGBM Classification** model using the **LightGBM** and **Scikit-learn** libraries to predict categorical target values from structured datasets.  
LightGBM is a high-performance gradient boosting framework that is optimized for speed and efficiency, making it one of the most powerful ML algorithms for classification tasks.

## 📘 Project Overview
LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is an advanced boosting algorithm that uses decision tree learners and histogram-based learning to improve both accuracy and speed.  
In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂ Split data into training and testing sets  
- ⚡ Train a model using **LGBMClassifier**  
- 📈 Visualize predictions and compare with actual values  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance with classification metrics:  
  - Accuracy Score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
  - ROC-AUC Score
