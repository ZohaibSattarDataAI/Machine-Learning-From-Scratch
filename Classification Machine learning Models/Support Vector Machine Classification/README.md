# 🎯 Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVM-C) using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a *Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVC)* using the Scikit-learn library for binary classification tasks. It highlights the ability of SVM to separate classes effectively using hyperplanes and kernel tricks, making it a powerful algorithm for high-dimensional data.

## 📘 Project Overview
Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models used for classification and regression tasks. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and preprocess the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- ✂ Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
- ⚡ Train a model using `SVC()` with key hyperparameters (`C`, `kernel`, `gamma`, `degree`)  
- 📈 Evaluate the model with metrics like:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
- 📉 Apply **Cross-Validation** to check model stability
