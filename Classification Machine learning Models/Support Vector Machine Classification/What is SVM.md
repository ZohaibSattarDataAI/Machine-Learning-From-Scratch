# 🎯 Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier

---

## 📘 What is SVM?
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** primarily used for **classification** and sometimes regression.  
It works by finding the **optimal hyperplane** that separates data points of different classes with the **maximum margin**.  
SVM can also use **kernel tricks** (like polynomial, RBF, sigmoid) to handle non-linear decision boundaries.

## 🔍 Description
The **Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVMC)** is one of the most powerful models in machine learning for **binary and multi-class classification**.  
It transforms input data into higher-dimensional space (if needed) and finds the best decision boundary that maximizes separation between classes.  
SVM is widely recognized for its **robustness in high-dimensional data** and **ability to generalize well**.

## 📂 Usages of SVMC
- 🏅 **Sports Analytics** → Player performance classification, win/loss prediction.  
- 🏥 **Healthcare** → Disease diagnosis (e.g., cancer detection).  
- 💳 **Finance** → Fraud detection, credit risk scoring.  
- 📧 **Spam Detection** → Classifying emails as spam or not.  
- 📊 **Image & Text Classification** → Object recognition, sentiment analysis.

## ⚙️ Applications
1. **Binary Classification** → e.g., Yes/No, Spam/Not Spam.  
2. **Multi-class Classification** → Using one-vs-one or one-vs-rest strategies.  
3. **Anomaly Detection** → Identifying outliers in datasets.  
4. **Pattern Recognition** → Handwriting, facial recognition, medical imaging.
