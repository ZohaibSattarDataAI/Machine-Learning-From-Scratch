# 🎯 Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement an **Extra Trees Classification** model using the Scikit-learn library to predict class labels based on structured datasets. It highlights the efficiency of randomized decision trees in improving accuracy and speed by averaging multiple de-correlated trees.

## 📘 Project Overview
Extra Trees (Extremely Randomized Trees) is an **ensemble learning method** that builds a large number of unpruned decision trees. Unlike Random Forest, Extra Trees choose split thresholds randomly, which increases variance reduction and often leads to better generalization. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `ExtraTreesClassifier()`  
- 📈 Visualize performance with confusion matrix and feature importance  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - ROC-AUC

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a **structured dataset** (job skills dataset in this case), where the goal is to predict whether a candidate is **suitable (1)** or **not suitable (0)** for a role. This dataset provides a strong platform to demonstrate tree-based classification for real-world predictive tasks.
