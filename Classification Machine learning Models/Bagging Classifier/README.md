# 🎯 Bagging Classifier using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Bagging Classification** model using the **Scikit-learn** library. It showcases the power of ensemble learning, where multiple base estimators are trained independently and combined to produce a more stable and accurate prediction than any individual model.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
**Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** is an ensemble technique that reduces variance and helps prevent overfitting. It works by training multiple models (usually decision trees) on different random subsets of the dataset and then aggregating their predictions through majority voting.

In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and inspect the dataset  
- 🧹 Perform **data cleaning and preprocessing**  
- 📊 Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**  
- ✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `BaggingClassifier()` with a **Decision Tree** base estimator  
- 📈 Visualize model performance and metrics  
- 📏 Evaluate results using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy Score  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-Score  
  - Confusion Matrix

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a **Sensor Fault Detection dataset**, which includes multiple features representing sensor readings and a target variable indicating whether a fault has occurred.  
It serves as an excellent real-world example for testing the robustness of ensemble classifiers.
