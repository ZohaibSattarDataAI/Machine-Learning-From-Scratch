# üß† What is Bagging Classifier?

**Bagging Classifier** (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an **ensemble learning technique** that combines the predictions of multiple base models to improve accuracy, stability, and generalization.  
It trains several models independently on random subsets of the training data and aggregates their predictions through **majority voting**.  
This method helps to reduce **variance** and avoid **overfitting**, particularly for algorithms like decision trees.

## üìù Description
Bagging is based on the principle of creating multiple versions of a predictor and using them to get an aggregated prediction.  
Each model (or base estimator) is trained on a **bootstrapped sample**‚Äîa random subset of the dataset selected with replacement.  
By combining these models, Bagging ensures that errors from individual weak learners are minimized in the final decision.

The most common base learner used with Bagging is the **Decision Tree Classifier**, which benefits greatly from this approach since it‚Äôs naturally prone to high variance.

**Common Applications:**
- Fault detection and quality control systems  
- Fraud and credit risk detection  
- Spam email classification  
- Customer churn prediction  
- Medical diagnosis and disease classification  
- Image recognition and sensor data classification
