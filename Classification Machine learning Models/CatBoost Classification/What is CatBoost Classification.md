## 📘 What is CatBoost?
**CatBoost (Categorical Boosting)** is a **gradient boosting algorithm** developed by Yandex.  
It is designed to handle **categorical features natively**, eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing like one-hot encoding.  
CatBoost uses **oblivious decision trees** and advanced boosting techniques to deliver high accuracy, reduced overfitting, and faster training.

## 🔧 Usage
- **Type**: Ensemble Method → Gradient Boosting  
- **Base Learner**: Oblivious Decision Trees (symmetric trees)  
- **Applications**: Primarily **Classification** and **Regression** tasks  
- **Key Parameters**:  
  - **iterations** → Number of boosting rounds (default = 1000)  
  - **learning_rate** → Step size for weight updates (default = 0.03)  
  - **depth** → Depth of trees (default = 6)  
  - **l2_leaf_reg** → L2 regularization coefficient (default = 3)  
  - **loss_function** → e.g., `"Logloss"` for classification

## 📖 Description
CatBoost improves boosting by:  
1. Handling **categorical features directly** using techniques like **target statistics** and **ordered boosting**.  
2. Using **symmetric trees** (same structure at every level), making it faster and less prone to overfitting.  
3. Reducing the impact of overfitting through **ordered boosting**, which prevents target leakage.  
4. Supporting **GPU acceleration** for large datasets.  

👉 These innovations make CatBoost **robust, accurate, and efficient** for real-world datasets, especially those with mixed feature types.
