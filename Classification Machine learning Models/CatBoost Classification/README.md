## 📘 Project Overview
CatBoost (Categorical Boosting) is an advanced gradient boosting algorithm that handles categorical features natively and provides state-of-the-art accuracy with reduced overfitting.  
In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂ Split data using train_test_split()  
- ⚡ Train a model using `CatBoostClassifier()` with categorical feature handling  
- 📈 Evaluate the classifier using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report  
- 🔄 Perform Cross-Validation to check model stability  
- 🔑 Visualize feature importance for model interpretability
