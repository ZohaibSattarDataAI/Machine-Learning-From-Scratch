# 🌲 Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Random Forest Classification** model using the Scikit-learn library to classify data with high accuracy. Random Forest is a powerful ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines them to form a strong predictive model, making it robust against overfitting and noise.

## 📘 Project Overview
Random Forest is widely used for classification tasks due to its ability to handle high-dimensional data, reduce variance, and provide reliable feature importance insights. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and preprocess the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂️ Split data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train the model using `RandomForestClassifier()`  
- 📈 Evaluate model performance with metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1-score  
  - Confusion Matrix  
- 🔄 Perform **Cross-validation** to validate the stability of the model  
- 📊 Visualize predictions and confusion matrix

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Iris dataset** (extended), a classical dataset for supervised learning. It contains multiple features of iris flowers and a categorical target variable representing the species. This dataset is ideal for demonstrating classification algorithms and model evaluation techniques.
