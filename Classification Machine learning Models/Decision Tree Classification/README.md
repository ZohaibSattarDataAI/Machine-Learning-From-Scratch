# 🎯 Decision Tree Classifier using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Decision Tree Classifier** using the Scikit-learn library to classify target values based on structured datasets. It highlights the interpretability and simplicity of decision trees, making them one of the most widely used algorithms for classification tasks.

## 📘 Project Overview
A Decision Tree is a supervised learning algorithm used for **classification and regression tasks**. It splits the dataset into branches based on feature conditions, ultimately forming a tree-like structure where each leaf node represents a class label.  
In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `DecisionTreeClassifier()`  
- 📈 Visualize the decision tree structure  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1 Score  
  - Confusion Matrix

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset **Credit_scoring** used in this project is a structured dataset representing input features and their associated class labels. It provides an excellent platform to demonstrate tree-based classification methods for real-world predictive tasks.
