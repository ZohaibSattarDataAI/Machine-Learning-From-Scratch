# 🎯 AdaBoost Regressor using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement an **AdaBoost Regression** model using the Scikit-learn library to predict target values based on structured datasets. It highlights the power of boosting algorithms in improving accuracy by combining multiple weak learners into a strong predictive model.

## 📘 Project Overview
AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple weak learners, typically shallow decision trees, and combines them to form a strong learner. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore the dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- ⚡ Train a model using `AdaBoostRegressor()` with a Decision Tree base estimator  
- 📈 Visualize actual vs predicted values  
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
  - R² Score
