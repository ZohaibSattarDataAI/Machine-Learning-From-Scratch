# 💳 XGBoost Regression for Financial Transaction Prediction using Scikit-learn & XGBoost

This project demonstrates how to build a high-performance **XGBoost Regression** model using *Scikit-learn* and *XGBoost* to predict a continuous financial target variable based on structured transaction data. The model learns from user activity and financial behavior to forecast a custom prediction metric — ideal for credit scoring, churn forecasting, or spending prediction.

## 📘 Project Overview

*XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)* is a cutting-edge ensemble learning algorithm designed for accuracy, scalability, and speed. In this notebook, we implement a complete regression pipeline including:

- 📥 Load and inspect a structured financial dataset  
- 📊 Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂️ Split the dataset using `train_test_split()`  
- 🧼 Feature engineering and standardization using `StandardScaler()`  
- 🧠 Train an `XGBRegressor()` model  
- 📈 Evaluate using key regression metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score  
- 🔍 Analyze feature importance to understand model decision-making  
- 🧠 Derive business insights and actionable outcomes

## 📊 About the Dataset

This dataset captures key financial and behavioral indicators for individuals. It is tailored to predict a numeric target (e.g., likelihood of spending, risk, credit value) based on:

- 👤 `age` — Age of the customer  
- ⏳ `account_age_months` — How long the user has had an account  
- 🔁 `num_transactions` — Total number of past transactions  
- 💵 `avg_transaction_value` — Average amount spent per transaction  
- 🧮 `credit_score` — Credit health indicator  
- 💰 `income` — Monthly or yearly income  
- 📆 `days_since_last_transaction` — Recency metric  
- 💳 `transaction_amount` — Last transaction's monetary value  
- 🎯 `Prediction` — Target variable for regression

## ✅ Final Conclusion

In this project, we built a robust **XGBoost Regression Model** to predict transaction-related outcomes using structured customer financial data.

### 🔍 Key Takeaways:

- ✨ **Feature Engineering**: Carefully selected impactful features like `credit_score`, `income`, and `transaction_amount`.
- 🧠 **High Model Performance**: XGBoost achieved strong accuracy across MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics.
- 📌 **Business Insight**: Feature importance clearly showed which behaviors (e.g., transaction frequency or income) most impact predictions.

This project reflects best practices in modern ML workflows — from data prep to business-driven outcomes. It showcases **ensemble learning in action**, making it a powerful addition to any data science portfolio.
