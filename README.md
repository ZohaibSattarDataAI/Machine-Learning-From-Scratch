# 🤖 Machine Learning From Scratch

Welcome to **Machine Learning From Scratch** — a comprehensive, beginner-friendly, and professional repository containing classic **Machine Learning algorithms** implemented in two ways:

✅ **From Scratch (Pure Python)** — for complete understanding of the math and logic  
✅ **With Scikit-learn** — for production-ready and fast implementation  

> 📌 This project includes **only Machine Learning** algorithms (no deep learning), with clean code, real datasets, and Jupyter notebooks for practice.
