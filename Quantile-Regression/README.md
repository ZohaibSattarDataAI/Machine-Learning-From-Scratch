# 📊 Quantile Regression for Advanced Predictive Modelling
This is my **[20]th** project in the field of Machine Learning and Regression Modelling.

This project demonstrates how to implement **Quantile Regression** — a powerful regression technique that predicts conditional quantiles of the target variable distribution. Unlike traditional regression methods that focus solely on the mean, Quantile Regression provides deeper insights into the data by modeling the entire conditional distribution.

It showcases a complete regression pipeline — from data exploration to model training and evaluation — offering a strong foundation for solving prediction tasks where understanding different points (quantiles) of the target distribution is crucial. This is highly useful in fields such as finance, environmental science, healthcare analytics, and risk management.

## 📘 Project Overview
Quantile Regression estimates the relationship between features and specific quantiles of the target variable. By focusing on different quantiles (e.g., median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile), it gives a more complete picture of the potential outcomes.

In this notebook, we walk through the end-to-end regression process, covering:

- 📥 **Loading and inspecting the dataset**
- 🔍 **Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- 🧼 **Preprocessing and scaling features** where necessary
- ✂ **Splitting the dataset** using `train_test_split()`
- 🧠 **Training a regression model** using `QuantileRegressor()`
- 📈 **Evaluating the model** using regression metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- 📊 **Visualizing predicted vs. actual values** with regression and scatter plots

## 📊 About the Dataset
The dataset is based on **real-world scenarios** where modeling different quantiles is valuable — in this case, **Data Science Job Demand Analysis** across various regions and skill sets.

It includes:
- 📢 **Domain-Specific Indicators** — features such as skill demand index, average job posting views, competition level, and location category
- 📉 **Target Variable** — numerical variable representing job demand levels at different quantiles

The dataset reflects situations where different stakeholders (students, AI engineers, recruiters, and policy makers) need more than just the average prediction — they need insights into the full range of possible outcomes.
