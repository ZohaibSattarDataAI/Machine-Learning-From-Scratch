# 🧮 Bayesian Ridge Regression for Sales Revenue Prediction using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a *Bayesian Ridge Regression* model using the *Scikit-learn* library to predict sales revenue based on website visit traffic. Bayesian Ridge is especially useful for regression problems where multicollinearity may exist, or when we want to introduce probabilistic reasoning into our models.

## 📘 Project Overview

*Bayesian Ridge Regression* is a linear regression technique that includes regularization and incorporates prior probability distributions to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. In this notebook, we implement the complete machine learning pipeline for regression using Scikit-learn, covering:

> 🧠 **When to Use It:**  
Bayesian Ridge Regression is particularly effective when working with **small to medium datasets**, **high-dimensional features**, or **datasets with multicollinearity**—where traditional linear regression may become unstable. It’s also suitable when you want **probabilistic predictions with uncertainty estimates**, such as in **finance**, **healthcare cost estimation**, or **scientific forecasting** tasks.

- 📥 Generate and load a synthetic dataset  
- 📊 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂ Split the dataset using train_test_split()  
- 🔧 Scale features using StandardScaler()  
- 🧠 Train a model using BayesianRidge()  
- 📈 Evaluate model using regression metrics:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- 📉 Visualize predictions vs actual values using scatter and line plots

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset is **synthetic** and created to simulate a strong correlation between website traffic and resulting sales revenue. It contains the following columns:

- 🌐 *website_visits* — Number of visits to a website  
- 💰 *sales_revenue* — Total revenue generated (target variable)  

The dataset is well-structured for real-world regression tasks related to marketing and web analytics.
