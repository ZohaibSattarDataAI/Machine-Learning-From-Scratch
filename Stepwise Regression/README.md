# 📊 Stepwise Regression (Forward & Backward) for Feature Selection & Predictive Modeling  

This is my [23]th project in the field of **Machine Learning and Regression Modeling**.  

This project demonstrates how to implement **Stepwise Regression** — a systematic feature selection technique that adds or removes predictors iteratively based on statistical significance and model performance — to build accurate and interpretable predictive models.  

It showcases a complete end-to-end regression workflow: from **data preparation and feature selection** to **model training and evaluation**, making it a strong portfolio-ready project for practical business and research applications.

## 📘 Project Overview  

**Stepwise Regression** is a hybrid of **forward selection** and **backward elimination**. It helps identify the most significant features from a dataset while avoiding overfitting.  

This approach:  
✅ Automatically selects the best subset of predictors  
✅ Improves model interpretability  
✅ Reduces noise from irrelevant variables  
✅ Balances model complexity with performance

## 🔑 End-to-End Workflow in this Notebook  

📥 Loading and exploring the dataset  
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas, Seaborn & Matplotlib  
🧼 Data preprocessing & splitting into training/testing sets  
⚡ Feature selection using **Forward Stepwise Regression**  
⚡ Feature selection using **Backward Stepwise Regression**  
🧠 Model training with **Linear Regression**  
📈 Model evaluation using:  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R² Score

## 📊 About the Dataset  

The dataset simulates real-world conditions where multiple predictors may or may not contribute to predicting a continuous target variable.  

- **📢 Feature Variables** — Multiple independent variables (e.g., experience, education, projects, certifications, hours per week).  
- **📉 Target Variable** — A continuous variable (e.g., salary prediction).
