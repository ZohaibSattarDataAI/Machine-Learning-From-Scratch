# 📈 Support Vector Regression (SVR) for GDP Growth Prediction using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a *Support Vector Regression (SVR)* model using the *Scikit-learn* library to predict GDP growth based on various economic indicators. It highlights the effectiveness of SVR in handling regression problems with complex, non-linear relationships between features and the target variable.

## 📘 Project Overview

*Support Vector Regression* is a powerful supervised learning algorithm capable of modeling both linear and non-linear relationships. In this notebook, we implement the full machine learning pipeline for regression using Scikit-learn, covering:

- 📥 Load and inspect the GDP growth dataset  
- 📊 Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
- ✂ Split the dataset using `train_test_split()`  
- 🔧 Preprocess features using `StandardScaler()`  
- 🧠 Train a regression model using `SVR()` with polynomial kernel  
- 🔍 Adjust model parameters for improved performance  
- 📈 Evaluate model performance using regression metrics:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
  - R² Score

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset contains GDP growth data along with multiple economic indicators. It is structured for regression tasks and includes features such as:

- 📈 *GDP Growth Rate* — The target variable representing annual GDP growth percentage  
- 💰 *Investment Rate* — Percentage of GDP spent on investments  
- 🏭 *Industrial Output* — Index representing industrial production levels  
- 👨‍👩‍👦 *Population Growth* — Annual population growth percentage  
- 📦 Other economic factors relevant to GDP performance  

This dataset is ideal for demonstrating regression techniques applied to economic forecasting.
