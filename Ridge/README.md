# 📈 Ridge Regression using Scikit-learn | ML Project #7

This project demonstrates how to apply **Ridge Regression** — a powerful linear regression technique with **L2 regularization** — using Python’s Scikit-learn library. It helps improve model performance by handling multicollinearity and reducing overfitting.

## 📘 Project Overview

**Ridge Regression** is a regularized version of linear regression that penalizes large coefficients. This helps the model generalize better on unseen data by minimizing overfitting.

In this notebook, we walk through:

- 📥 Data loading and exploration
- 🧹 Data cleaning and preprocessing
- ⚙️ Feature scaling with StandardScaler
- 🧠 Model training using `Ridge()`
- 📊 Evaluation with:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
- 📈 Visualization of prediction results
