📊 Theil-Sen Regression for Robust Predictive Modeling  
This is my [19]th project in the field of Machine Learning and Regression Modeling.  

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Theil-Sen Regressor** — a robust regression technique ideal for handling outliers and noisy data — to predict target variables based on multiple real-world features.  
It showcases a complete regression pipeline — from data exploration to model training and evaluation — offering a strong foundation for solving real-world prediction tasks in various industries, including healthcare, finance, and environmental science.  

📘 Project Overview  
The **Theil-Sen Regressor** is a non-parametric method that estimates the slope as the median of slopes between all pairs of points. This makes it highly resistant to the influence of outliers compared to traditional linear regression.  
In this notebook, we walk through the end-to-end regression process, covering:  

📥 Loading and inspecting the dataset  
🔍 Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
🧼 Preprocessing features for optimal model performance  
✂ Splitting the dataset using `train_test_split()`  
🧠 Training a regression model using `TheilSenRegressor()`  
📈 Evaluating the model using regression metrics:  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score  

📊 Visualizing predicted vs. actual values with regression plots
