# 📊 Gamma Regression using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Gamma Regression model** using the Scikit-learn library to predict **E-commerce product demand**.  
It highlights how **generalized linear models (GLMs)** can handle **positive, skewed, and continuous target variables**, making them well-suited for business forecasting tasks.

## 📘 Project Overview

Gamma Regression is a type of **Generalized Linear Model (GLM)** that models **skewed continuous outcomes** (always positive values) using a Gamma distribution with a log link.  
In this notebook, we:

📥 Load and explore an E-commerce demand dataset  
📊 Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Seaborn and Matplotlib  
✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
🧠 Train a model using `GammaRegressor()` from Scikit-learn  
📈 Visualize **predicted vs. actual demand values**  
📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset simulates **real-world e-commerce demand forecasting**, where demand is influenced by multiple business factors.  

It includes:  
- 🛒 **Features** — Product-level attributes and influencing factors  
- 📦 **Target Variable** — Demand (continuous, positive numeric values)  

This dataset is ideal for demonstrating how **Gamma Regression** handles skewed demand data effectively.
