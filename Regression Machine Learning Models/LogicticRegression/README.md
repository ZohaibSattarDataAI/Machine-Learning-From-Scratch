# 🧠 Logistic Regression on Social Network Ads | ML Project #2

This project implements a *Logistic Regression* model using the *Scikit-learn* library to predict whether a user will purchase a product based on their demographic features (age, salary, etc.). This binary classification problem showcases the fundamentals of logistic regression and model evaluation.

## 📘 Project Overview

In this notebook, we walk through a complete machine learning pipeline using Logistic Regression:

- 📥 Load and explore the **Social Network Ads** dataset  
- 📊 Perform EDA with **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**  
- ✂ Split data using `train_test_split()`  
- 🧼 Preprocess data using **Label Encoding** and **StandardScaler**  
- 🧠 Train the model using `LogisticRegression()`  
- 📈 Evaluate performance with metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- 🖼 Visualize results with heatmaps and scatterplots

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset is extracted from a social network's advertising platform and includes user demographics:

- 🧑‍💼 `Gender` – Categorical (Male/Female)
- 👴 `Age` – Numerical
- 💰 `EstimatedSalary` – Numerical
- ✅ `Purchased` – Target (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

The goal is to predict whether a user is likely to purchase the advertised product.
