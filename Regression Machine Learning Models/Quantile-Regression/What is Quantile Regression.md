# ðŸ“Š Quantile Regression

## 1. Definition
Quantile Regression is a type of regression analysis used in statistics and econometrics that estimates the conditional quantiles (such as the median or the 90th percentile) of the dependent variable. Unlike Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), which estimates the mean of the dependent variable, Quantile Regression provides a more comprehensive view of the relationship between variables by modeling different points in the distribution.

## 2. Applications
- **Income and Wage Analysis:** Understand income distribution and inequality.
- **Risk Management:** Estimate Value-at-Risk (VaR) in finance.
- **Healthcare Studies:** Model patient recovery times at different quantiles.
- **Environmental Studies:** Analyze extreme weather events or pollution levels.
- **Real Estate:** Predict housing prices at different market segments.

## 3. Usage
Quantile Regression is used when:
- The conditional distribution of the dependent variable is skewed.
- We want to understand the impact of predictors across different points in the distribution.
- Outliers might distort mean-based estimates.
- There is heteroscedasticity in the data.

## 4. Pros
- Robust to outliers compared to OLS.
- Provides a more detailed understanding of relationships across the distribution.
- Useful for heteroscedastic data where variance changes with predictors.
- Can model non-central tendencies like medians or tails.

## 5. Cons
- Interpretation is more complex than OLS.
- Computationally more intensive.
- Requires larger sample sizes for reliable tail quantile estimation.
- Not as widely supported in some statistical software compared to OLS.

## 6. Conclusion
Quantile Regression extends beyond average-based modeling to capture the complete relationship between variables across their distribution. It is especially valuable in fields where understanding extremes, medians, or other specific points of the outcome variable is crucial.
