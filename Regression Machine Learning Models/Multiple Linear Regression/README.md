# 📊 Multiple Linear Regression using Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to implement a **Multiple Linear Regression** model in Python using the **Scikit-learn** library. The model is trained on a structured dataset to predict salary based on multiple input features like education level, experience, age, and city tier.

## 📘 Project Overview

Multiple Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning technique used to model the linear relationship between one dependent variable and two or more independent variables. In this notebook, we:

- 📥 Load and explore a structured dataset
- 📊 Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
- ✂️ Split data using `train_test_split()`
- 🧠 Train a regression model using `LinearRegression()`
- 📈 Visualize actual vs predicted values
- 📏 Evaluate model performance using metrics such as:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score

## 📊 About the Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a **synthetic salary prediction dataset** designed for learning purposes. It contains realistic features commonly found in job market data, such as:

- 🎓 **Education Level** — Bachelors, Masters, PhD  
- 💼 **Years of Experience** — Numeric field  
- 🧓 **Age** — Numeric field  
- 🏙️ **City Tier** — City classification into Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 3  
- 💰 **Salary** — Target variable (dependent)

This synthetic dataset allows for a clear demonstration of multiple linear regression without the complications of noisy real-world data. However, the structure is similar to what you might encounter in real-world applications.
