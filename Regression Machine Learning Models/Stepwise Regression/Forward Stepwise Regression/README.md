# 📊 Forward Stepwise Regression for Feature Selection & Predictive Modeling  

This is my [24]th project in the field of **Machine Learning and Regression Modeling**.  

This project demonstrates how to implement **Forward Stepwise Regression** — a systematic feature selection technique that starts with no predictors and iteratively adds the most statistically significant variable at each step until no further improvement is observed.  

It showcases a complete end-to-end regression workflow: from **data preparation and feature selection** to **model training and evaluation**, making it a strong portfolio-ready project for practical business and research applications.

## 📘 Project Overview  

**Forward Stepwise Regression** builds models step-by-step by adding predictors:  
✅ Starts with an empty model  
✅ Adds features one by one that improve performance the most  
✅ Stops when no significant improvement is gained  
✅ Produces a compact, interpretable, and accurate model  

This approach is especially useful when dealing with datasets that have many potential predictors, but not all are relevant.

## 🔑 End-to-End Workflow in this Notebook  

📥 Loading and exploring the dataset  
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Pandas, Seaborn & Matplotlib  
🧼 Data preprocessing & splitting into training/testing sets  
⚡ Feature selection using **Forward Stepwise Regression (SFS)**  
🧠 Model training with **Linear Regression**  
📈 Model evaluation using:  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
   - R² Score

## 📊 About the Dataset  

The dataset simulates real-world conditions where multiple predictors may or may not contribute to predicting a continuous target variable.  

- **📢 Feature Variables** — Multiple independent variables (e.g., experience, education, projects, certifications, hours per week).  
- **📉 Target Variable** — A continuous variable (e.g., salary prediction).
