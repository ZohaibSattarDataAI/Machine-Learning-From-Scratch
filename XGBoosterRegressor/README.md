# ⚡ XGBoost Regression for Electricity Consumption Forecasting using Scikit-learn and XGBoost

This project demonstrates how to build a high-performance **XGBoost Regression** model using *Scikit-learn* and *XGBoost* libraries to forecast **electricity consumption** based on household-level attributes and behavioral factors. The project emphasizes the power of ensemble learning in solving real-world energy consumption prediction problems.

## 📘 Project Overview

*XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)* is one of the most powerful and widely-used ensemble learning algorithms in supervised machine learning. This notebook walks through a complete end-to-end pipeline for regression using XGBoost, including:

- 📥 Load and explore an energy-related dataset  
- 📊 Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- ✂ Preprocess and split the dataset using `train_test_split()`  
- 🧼 Handle feature selection and encoding of categorical variables  
- 🧠 Train an `XGBRegressor` model  
- 📈 Evaluate model performance using:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
  - R² Score  
- 📊 Visualize feature importance to understand energy usage drivers  
- 📌 Derive business and policy-related insights from the results

## 🔌 About the Dataset

The dataset contains synthetic but realistic information about household-level electricity usage. It is ideal for understanding the relationship between various demographic and behavioral variables and electricity consumption. Key columns include:

- 🏠 `household_id` — Unique identifier for each household  
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 `num_occupants` — Number of people in the household  
- 🔌 `appliance_count` — Number of electrical appliances  
- 🌡️ `avg_temp_celsius` — Average recorded temperature  
- ⏰ `weekday_usage_hours` — Daily electricity usage during weekdays  
- 📅 `weekend_usage_hours` — Electricity usage on weekends  
- ⚡ `electricity_consumption_kwh` — Target variable representing electricity consumed in kilowatt-hours
